  <p>
    The <strong>&lt;container&gt;&lt;/container&gt;</strong>
    and <strong>&lt;grid responsive&gt;&lt;/grid&gt;</strong> elements are components
    which generate and update the appropriate class based on their width
  </p>

  <p>
    These components subscribe to the width property on the device/layout service,
    and recalculate their width whenever it changes.  They then add a class name
    to their element based on comparing their width to your breakpoints.
