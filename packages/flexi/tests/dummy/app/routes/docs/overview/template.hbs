    Flexi is a layout framework built to solve difficult maintainability and performance concerns
    on projects with responsive designs or that ship layouts for more than one screen size.
  </p>

  <p>
    Flexi will help you build faster, smarter, with an eye on long term needs and goals, and it
    integrates well with existing Ember projects of any size.
  </p>

  <p>
    Flexi is small and focused, and won't clog your runtime. It gives you declarative layout
    features that are processed at build time, leaving the most minimal runtime footprint
    possible and without bloating the size of your app.
  </p>

  <p>
    Flexi is not a ui framework.  It is a small set of layout primitives that make it simple
    to design for a range of device sizes and platforms, and will easily integrate with your
    existing ui-framework and/or grid-system of choice.
