      Use the sustain helper to explicitly declare component instances that can be recycled. This lets Ember recycle a
      component instance and it's associated DOM across layout and route boundaries.

    {{#let (get-code-snippet "sustain-1.hbs") as |snippet|}}
      <pre class={{snippet.language}}>{{snippet.source}}</pre>
    {{/let}}

    <p>
      A sustain is essentially a "marker" for where a particular component instance should be inserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the component a sustain specifies is moved from marker to marker, only one marker instance for a given
      component name can be used at a time, unless a unique label is provided.
    </p>
    <p>
      This produces a significant performance advantage by allowing you to seamlessly restructure your app's DOM when
      shifting from one layout or route to another without needing to teardown and rebuild DOM.

    <h3>Providing a model for your component</h3>

    {{#let (get-code-snippet "sustain-2.hbs") as |snippet|}}
      <pre class={{snippet.language}}>{{snippet.source}}</pre>
    {{/let}}

    <h4>Complex Models</h4>
    <p>
      Use the hash helper to handle more complex model situations.
    </p>
    {{#let (get-code-snippet "sustain-3.hbs") as |snippet|}}
      <pre class={{snippet.language}}>{{snippet.source}}</pre>
    {{/let}}

    <h3>Dealing with animation and other scenarios in which two instances exist at once.</h3>
    <p>
      Only one instance of the sustainable is alive and rendered at a time, but if you are animating from one location
      to another you can choose to leave behind a copy.
    </p>
    {{#let (get-code-snippet "sustain-4.hbs") as |snippet|}}
      <pre class={{snippet.language}}>{{snippet.source}}</pre>
    {{/let}}

    <h3>Configuring the component's cache expire time.</h3>
    <p>
      By default, a sustain is destroyed when it has gone unused for 5 seconds. You can alter this expiration. A value
      of 0 or -1 will cause the sustain to live forever.
    </p>
    {{#let (get-code-snippet "sustain-5.hbs") as |snippet|}}
      <pre class={{snippet.language}}>{{snippet.source}}</pre>
    {{/let}}

    <h3>Labeling a sustain</h3>
    <p>
      If you need more than one instance of a component to be recycleable, you may provide a unique label for the
      sustain. The instance will only be reused in locations where that label appears in conjunction with the same
      Component Name.
    </p>
    {{#let (get-code-snippet "sustain-6.hbs") as |snippet|}}
      <pre class={{snippet.language}}>{{snippet.source}}</pre>
    {{/let}}

    <h4>Lifecycle Hooks</h4>
    <p>
      The component being sustained has access to two new hooks: `willMove` and `didMove`. For both, a method by that
      name on your component will trigger before the event fires.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>willMove: fires before a component instance leaves a location</li>
      <li>didMove: fires when a component instance has entered a location</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      On the initial render and insertion of a sustained component, only `didMove` triggers.
    </p>
