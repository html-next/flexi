# Flexi-default-styles

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40html-next%2Fflexi-default-styles.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40html-next%2Fflexi-default-styles)

Default styles to match the attributes converted by [flexi-dsl](https://github.com/html-next/flexi/tree/main/packages/flexi-dsl), as well as styles for the [flexi-layouts](https://github.com/html-next/flexi/tree/main/packages/flexi-layouts) components.

### Installation

It is recommended that you manage your flexi addons through [the main flexi addon](https://github.com/html-next/flexi/tree/main/packages/flexi):

```cli
ember install flexi
```

This will provide a prompt to install only the addons you want. Flexi will also maintain
compatibility between addons.

Alternatively install just this package:

```cli
ember instal @html-next/flexi-default-styles
```

Note that that flexi attributes will not be converted into classes without [flexi-dsl](https://github.com/html-next/flexi/tree/main/packages/flexi-dsl).
