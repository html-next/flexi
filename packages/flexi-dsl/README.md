# Flexi-dsl

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40html-next%2Fflexi-dsl.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40html-next%2Fflexi-dsl)

Attribute and layout-component conversions for flexi elements.

Attributes: https://flexi.readme.io/docs/attributes

`<container>` and `<grid responsive>` layout components: https://flexi.readme.io/docs/elements

### Installation

It is recommended that you manage your flexi addons through [the main flexi addon](https://github.com/html-next/flexi):

```cli
ember install flexi
```

This will provide a prompt to install only the addons you want. Flexi will also maintain
compatibility between addons.

Alternatively install just this package:

```cli
ember instal @html-next/flexi-dsl
```

Note that no default styles will be included unless you also install [flexi-default-styles](https://github.com/html-next/flexi/tree/main/packages/flexi-default-styles).
