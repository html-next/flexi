Flexi is a responsive-design layout framework like Bootstrap and Foundation. Flexi is focused on performance and maintainability, utilizing Ember for greater configuration and convenience than soluions like Bootstrap or Foundation
could offer.

Flexi is also unopinionated about your CSS. You can configure it to utilize your existing CSS, or the CSS of any design
framework.

Flexi does most of it's heavy lifting at `build` time, happily adding very little runtime code and little-to-no CSS to your project.
